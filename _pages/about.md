I am a postdoctoral research associate at Caltech, co-advised by [Prof. William Clemons](http://clemonslab.caltech.edu) and [Prof. Richard Murray](https://murray.cds.caltech.edu/Main_Page). My research interest is enabling biology by design, creating synthetic biological systems with a defined purpose.

Before joining Caltech, I received my Ph.D. in Chemical & Biomolecular Engineering from [Prof. Mark Styczynski](https://sites.gatech.edu/styczynski/)'s lab at Georgia Tech, where I focused on developing cell-free biosensors for point-of-care diagnostics. I earned my B.S. in Chemical & Biomolecular Engineering from Cornell University, where I was first introduced to synthetic biology in [Prof. Julius Lucks](https://luckslab.org)'s lab focused on developing RNA-based genetic regulators. 

Please refer to the [Publications page](/publications) for more details about my research background.

My research interests include cell-free synthetic biology, protein self-assembly, biosensor diagnostics, and precision medicine.
