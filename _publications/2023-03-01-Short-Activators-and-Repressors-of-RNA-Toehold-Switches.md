excerpt: 'RNA toehold switches are a widely used class of molecule to detect specific RNA “trigger” sequences, but their design, intended function, and characterization to date leave it unclear whether they can function properly with triggers shorter than 36 nucleotides. Here, we explore the feasibility of using standard toehold switches with 23-nucleotide truncated triggers. We assess the crosstalk of different triggers with significant homology and identify a highly sensitive trigger region where just one mutation from the consensus trigger sequence can reduce switch activation by 98.6\%. However, we also find that triggers with as many as seven mutations outside of this region can still lead to 5-fold induction of the switch. We also present a new approach using 18- to 22-nucleotide triggers as translational repressors for toehold switches and assess the off-target regulation for this strategy as well. The development and characterization of these strategies could help enable applications like microRNA sensors, where well-characterized crosstalk between sensors and detection of short target sequences are critical.'
