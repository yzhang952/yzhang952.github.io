excerpt: 'Field-deployable diagnostics based on cell-free systems have advanced greatly, but on-site quantification of target analytes remains a challenge. Here we demonstrate that Escherichia coli lysate-based cell-free biosensors coupled to a personal glucose monitor (PGM) can enable on-site analyte quantification, with the potential for straightforward reconfigurability to diverse types of analytes. We show that analyte-responsive regulators of transcription and translation can modulate the production of the reporter enzyme Î²-galactosidase, which in turn converts lactose into glucose for PGM quantification. Because glycolysis is active in the lysate and would readily deplete converted glucose, we decoupled enzyme production and glucose conversion to increase the end point signal output. However, this lysate metabolism did allow for one-pot removal of glucose present in complex samples (like human serum) without confounding target quantification. Taken together, our results show that integrating lysate-based cell-free biosensors with PGMs enables accessible target detection and quantification at the point of need.'
